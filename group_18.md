### Appendix

The original question:

Documentation and reproducibility - (1) Mention all the official documentation resources. (2) Are there ways to run the dashboard in a reproducible way locally (ie., creating a package?, Docker? Binder? Nothing is said about it?) Provide links/examples if you find that it is possible.
