### Long description

#### When was it created?

Dash was created and released in 2017 as a Python library.

#### Are other companies involved in the current development of this technology?

`Plotly` is a Canada-based company which built Dash and supports its current development until now. `Plotly`, as the company, open-sourced Dash and released it under an MIT license, so people can use Dash for free.

There is also a commercial companion that is shared by `Plotly` called `Dash Enterprise`. This service provides companies with support services including hosting, deploying, and handling authentication on Dash applications for certain amount of costs. But these features do not belong to Dash’s open source ecosystem.

Additionally, in order to build the user interface layer of Python, R and Julia, Dash teamed up with friends at `Formidable` which is known for world-class React application development and tooling. 

#### Is possible to be used with different languages.

Yes, Dash has grown to include implementations for other languages like `R` and `Julia` and F# (only experimental) which makes it much easier for data scientists to build analytically web applications without requiring advanced web development knowledge and coding skills. 

#### Since when?

It starts to be used with different languages like `R` since 2019 and `Julia` since 2020.
