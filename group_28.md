## Shiny History 
### Brief description

The open-source library Shiny was developed in 2012 by RStudio to help users build simple interactive web apps with no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript experience. The library is only avaliable in R so it works seamlessly with RStudio and RMarkdown.  RStudio is the current maintainer of the Shiny library, with the newest release (as of March 2022) being V1.7.1, which occurred in Oct 2021. Since 2012, there have been many updates to the library including adding support for shiny applications (V1.0.0), allowing asynchronous operations (V1.1.0), adding plot caching to improve the performance of apps, as well as better theming and accessibility (V1.6.0). Many of the improvements that have been made are to keep up with changes to the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) which is used by the Shiny library for building applications. With each new release, Shiny provides new features that allow for more functionality within the created apps as well as better performance. See their release history [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/main/NEWS.md) to get a full description of the library's update history.
